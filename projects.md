**GitHub Repository:** [Credit Default Classification](https://github.com/IshwarKapoor/IshwarKapoor/blob/main/Credit_Default_Classification_by_Ishwar.ipynb)

This project explores how to build, balance, and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting loan defaults - a major challenge in financial risk analysis.

### ⭐ Key Highlights
- Solved **10% minority class imbalance**
- Used **SMOTE oversampling** and **downsampling**
- Evaluated with:
  - Precision & Recall  
  - F1 Score  
  - Cohen’s Kappa  
- Found **optimal threshold** using:
  - Youden’s J  
  - Upper-Left Distance  
  - F1-max  
- Included detailed **ROC-AUC** analysis
