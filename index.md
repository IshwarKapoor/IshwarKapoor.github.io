# Welcome to World of Data

Ishwar Kapoor – Applied Data Scientist & Academic of Materials for Engineering

I’m an Applied Data Scientist and Academic with deep experience in data-driven research, statistical analysis, and experimental modeling in materials engineering.

My work focuses on analyzing large experimental datasets, understanding microstructure–property relationships, and developing predictive models using Python, Excel, and machine learning tools.

I often spend most of my time solving scientific and mathematical problems, so I don’t update GitHub or LinkedIn as often as I’d like, but I’m always open to connecting, collaborating, or discussing new ideas.

Feel free to reach out anytime!
